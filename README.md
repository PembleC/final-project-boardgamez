# Android Application: BoardGamez
By Carson Pemble, Terri Hewitt, and Tim O'Rourke


## About The Project
#### High-Level Description 
My team has created an application that our users could use as a board game collection manager. Our app allows users to keep track of the games that they own, want to own, or have played by using a tagging system. Our app uses the BoardGameGeek API to create a list of games, called a collection, that the user wants or has. Users can also view detailed information about games in their collection as well as get search results returned from BoardGameGeek. In addition, the board game manager app has a barcode scanning feature which can be used to scan the barcodes of games the user already owns. This allows for a simple way to add thier own board games into the collection management system.
